# Overview

This page contains the list of deprecations and important or breaking changes
for Vault 1.5.0 compared to 1.4.1. Please read it carefully.

## Known Issues

Enabling telemetry on 32-bit systems will cause Vault to crash.  A workaround for this
issue is to disable collection of usage gauges in the telemetry stanza of the configuration.

```
telemetry {
  ...
  usage_gauge_period = "none"
}
```

This will suppress the metrics `vault.identity.entity.count`, `vault.identity.entity.alias.count`, `vault.token.count`, `vault.token.count.by_auth`, `vault.token.count.by_policy`, `vault.token.count.by_ttl` and `vault.secret.kv.count`, but all other Vault telemetry will remain available.
